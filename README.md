# Computer Science: Concepts and Paradigms
Concepts, Paradigms and Design Patterns in Computer Science to develop higher quality code

# The four pillars of Object Oriented Programming

## Abstraction
## Encapsulation
## Inheritance
## Polymorphism
* Flexibility and extensibility by adding new classes without modifying existing code.
* Simplifies code by using a common interface for different data types.
* Improves code readability and maintainability.

# Solid Principles

## Single Responsibility

## Liskov Substitution

This priciple stands that If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

In practical software development it defines that objects of a superclass could be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
