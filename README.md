# The four pillars of Object Oriented Programming

## Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to focus on interactions at a higher level, without needing to understand the intricate details of how something works.

**Benefits**: Abstraction simplifies the interaction with objects by providing a clear, simplified interface and reducing the complexity of the code. It helps in managing and working with complex systems by breaking them down into more manageable parts.
## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the principle of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse.

**Benefits**: 
* It promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making code easier to manage, understand, and maintain.
* It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface for interaction.

## Inheritance
## Polymorphism

**Benefits**:
* Flexibility and extensibility by adding new classes without modifying existing code.
* Simplifies code by using a common interface for different data types.
* Improves code readability and maintainability.

# Solid Principles

## Single Responsibility

## Liskov Substitution

This priciple stands that If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

In practical software development it defines that objects of a superclass could be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
